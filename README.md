Gesture Learning for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems

## Requirements

Unreal Engine with AirSim Compatibility

AirSim Package

AirSim-Python Package

(optional) 3D map for self-driving car research and driving

## The Code
CarTest: Gives feedback and data on the hand gesture recognition algorithm's performance. Includes the Video Streamer.


CarSim: A real-time visualization of CarTest


Classifier: The Gesture Classifier model used as an example for GLADAS testing. This, as long as most of CarTest, can be changed to fit each individual research team's requirements and specifications.

## Paper
Full instructions and explanation of the code are coming soon.
